# 🧠 Computer Vision Projects

This repository contains a collection of small **computer vision (CV) projects** aimed at learning and applying key concepts across different areas of the field — from image classification to object detection, pose estimation, and beyond.

Each project is built to be practical and hands-on, focusing on understanding core principles, data handling, and model training in real-world scenarios.

## 🎾 Player Actions Classification

The first project in this series focuses on classifying tennis player shots.
We train a CNN-based classifier and compare its performance with a fine-tuned pre-trained model (MobileNetV3) to distinguish between:

- Forehand
- Backhand
- Serve
- Ready position

Dataset: [Tennis Player Actions Dataset for Human Pose Estimation](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/orvile/tennis-player-actions-dataset)

This project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and Grad-CAM explainability visualizations.

## 🚀 Future Projects

Planned extensions and future experiments include:

🏸 Object Detection – detecting racket or ball positions

🧍 Pose Estimation – keypoint detection for player posture

🎥 Action Recognition – understanding movements in video sequences

🖼️ Image Segmentation – separating objects or regions of interest
