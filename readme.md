# 🧠 CV Projects

This repository contains small **computer vision projects** designed to learn and apply fundamental concepts across different areas of the field — from image classification to object detection and beyond.

Each project focuses on understanding key principles, data handling, and model training in a practical, hands-on way.

## 🎾 Player Actions Classification

This initial project focuses on **classifying tennis player shots**. For this we will build and train a **CNN-based classifier** and compare it with **pre-trained models**.

The dataset used is called **"Tennis Player Actions Dataset for Human Pose Estimation"**. It can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/orvile/tennis-player-actions-dataset.

## 🚀 Future Projects

- Object detection (e.g., detecting racket or ball position)

- Pose estimation

- Action recognition in video sequences

- Image segmentation
